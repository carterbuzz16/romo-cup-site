            <h2>Who Was Will?</h2>
            <p>
              Will “Romo” Romanowski was easy-going, quick to laugh, and the
              kind of person who made people feel welcome immediately. He was a
              star student with a 4.05 GPA, a scholarship recipient at Auburn,
              and a proud Sigma Nu fraternity member.
            </p>
            <p>
              He loved baseball from every angle, from youth leagues to travel
              ball, from cheering for the Phillies to backing Auburn baseball.
              He dreamed of one day working in a Major League Baseball front
              office.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the accident, a note from Will was found and it became the
              heart of his legacy. Its spirit now drives this entire movement.

          <h2>What Happened?</h2>
          <p>
            Will tragically passed away in a car accident after his freshman
            year at Auburn.
          </p>
          <p>
            The loss was felt deeply by his family, his friends, Sigma Nu, and
            the broader Auburn community.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section card reveal">
          <h2>How Did The Romo Cup Begin?</h2>
          <p>
            It started simply: a whiffle ball game at Sigma Nu, a table flipped
            on its side, and “BBTY” written across it.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few fraternity leaders took that spark and formalized it into an
            official event. What began as one game grew into a
            multi-fraternity tournament in Will’s honor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why whiffle ball? Because Will loved baseball. Because it brings
            people together. Because it captures fun, friendship, and
            competition in the exact spirit he lived with.

          <h2>Why We Play</h2>
          <p>
            The mission is clear: raise $26,000+ to establish and fund the Will
            Romanowski Endowed Scholarship at Auburn University.
          </p>
          <p>
            This cements Will’s name in Auburn’s legacy, lightens the financial
            burden for a student, and shares Will’s story with every recipient.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is about more than money. It is about uniting the Greek
            community. It is about honoring legacy. It is about living
            “Be Better Than Yesterday.”
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section card reveal">
          <h2>Who Will Receive the Scholarship?</h2>
          <p>
            The Will Romanowski Endowed Scholarship is awarded annually to an
            Auburn student.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is designed to support a deserving student who embodies
            leadership, character, and community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every award keeps Will’s legacy alive for generations of Auburn
            students to come.
