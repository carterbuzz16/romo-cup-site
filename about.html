            <h2>William “Romo” Romanowski</h2>
            <p>
              William Romanowski, known as Romo, left behind more than memories.
              He left behind words that gave his family strength in one of the
              hardest seasons of their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              A note written by Will became a source of comfort and direction.
              While deeply personal, its message was clear: keep encouraging one
              another, keep showing up for people, and keep moving forward with
              purpose. That spirit now lives on through the Auburn University
              endowed scholarship, the Will "Romo" Scholarship, awarded each
              year to an Auburn student.
            </p>

              "Choose encouragement. Keep going. Be better than yesterday."

            <p>
              In honor of Will, his family created inspirational bracelets to
              share that same encouragement with others. Each bracelet is a
              reminder that hope can be carried, even through grief.

          <h2>From a Note to a Mission</h2>
          <p>
            What began as a private message became a public mission. The
            bracelets opened a way to comfort others while keeping Will’s spirit
            present in everyday life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Romo Cup grew from that same heartbeat. It is a day where
            competition, connection, and generosity come together to honor
            Will’s legacy and support the Auburn University endowed scholarship, the Will "Romo" Scholarship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every team, every supporter, and every donation helps turn memory
            into impact by strengthening community and funding an annual
            scholarship recipient: an Auburn student selected for the Will "Romo" Scholarship at Auburn University.
